# MySQL

We use MySQL as main database for our mailboxes.

Because everything is setup with docker. We propose 2 method to setup the MySQL
databases: manually setup or use automate script.

Good start points for reader:

- **manual.sh**: provide guideline allowing reader safely setup their own service.
- **start.sh**: automate script to start the MySQL and PHPMyadmin services.
- **clean.sh**: automate script to clear setup created by **start.sh**.

***Note***: carefully with another script than 3 above. Make sure you know what
you do and we do not guarantee for the bullet you shoot yourself.
